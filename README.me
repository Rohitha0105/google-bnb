How to Build an AI-Powered Personalized Recipe Maker with Flask and Gemini API
In today’s world, artificial intelligence is revolutionizing nearly every industry, and food tech is no exception. Imagine a tool that can identify ingredients in your pantry or interpret an image of a dish, then generate a personalized recipe just for you. With the Gemini API, you can bring this vision to life, combining the power of AI with a Flask web application to create a recipe generator based on images.

This blog will guide you step-by-step through building an AI-powered recipe maker using Python’s Flask framework, the Gemini API, and basic web development skills. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a working web application that analyzes images and generates recipes tailored to the dish

Introduction | Overview
Building a web application that generates recipes based on images requires integrating machine learning capabilities and a web framework. The problem this blog aims to solve is how to build a personalized recipe generator that can interpret images and suggest recipes accordingly. This tutorial will show you how to combine Flask, a Python-based web framework, with Google’s Gemini API, a powerful generative AI tool, to accomplish this task.

Target Audience:
Developers with basic experience in Flask and web development.
AI enthusiasts curious about integrating generative models into web applications.
Anyone interested in food tech or building AI-based applications.


Outcome:
By the end of this tutorial, you will have created a Flask-based web application that:

Accepts image uploads from users.
Processes the images using the Gemini API.
Generates and displays a personalized recipe based on the AI’s analysis.

Design
High-Level Architecture:
The architecture of this solution involves three major components:

Flask Web Application: The server-side logic to handle user interaction and requests.
Gemini API: The AI model that processes uploaded images and generates personalized recipes.
Frontend: Simple HTML forms for users to upload images and view results.

Design Choices:
Flask is chosen for its simplicity in setting up small-to-medium scale web applications.
Gemini API is used because of its generative capabilities, including image recognition and response generation, which is essential for creating personalized recipes.
File Upload Handling: The app saves images temporarily and uses the image path to process it with the Gemini API.
By structuring the app this way, we maintain separation between the user interface, backend logic, and AI processing, making it modular and easier to maintain.

Flowchart:
User uploads an image → Flask saves the image and sends it to Gemini API → Gemini API analyzes the image and generates a recipe → Flask displays the recipe on a results page.
